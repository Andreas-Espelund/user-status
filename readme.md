# User status 

## Get started

```bash
# clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:Andreas-Espelund/user-status.git

# move to the directory (unix)
cd user_status

# move to the directory (windows)
dir user_status

# install project dependencies
npm install

# run the application locally
npm run start
```

## Main files to change

| File | Content|
|--|--|
|index.html|Structure and elements/content|
|styles.css|Appearance and styling|
|script.js|Application logic|

## Build with electron

```bash
# install project dependencies
npm install

# run the application locally
npm run start

# build executable
npm run dist
```

The `npm run dist` command will create an executable or installer in the `dist` folder. This may look a little different based on the system it is run on.
